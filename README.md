Hardware Requirements
ESP32-CAM Module
FTDI USB to TTL converter
Jumper wires
Power supply (5V)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
ESP32 Board Package for Arduino
Edge Impulse Studio for model training
Python (optional, for additional scripts)
Installation
Set Up Arduino IDE:

Install the latest version of the Arduino IDE.
Add the ESP32 board package by navigating to File > Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs and adding the following link:
arduino
Copy code
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
Open Tools > Board > Board Manager, search for "ESP32," and install it.
Connect the ESP32-CAM:

Use the FTDI USB to TTL converter to connect the ESP32-CAM to your computer.
Make the appropriate connections (GND, VCC, TX, RX).
Upload Code:

Open the provided Arduino sketch in the IDE.
Modify the Wi-Fi credentials in the sketch.
Select the appropriate board and port, then upload the code.
Model Training and Deployment:

Use Edge Impulse Studio to train your object detection model based on the dataset of interest.
Export the model as TensorFlow Lite and upload it to the ESP32.
Usage
After uploading the code and deploying the model, open the Serial Monitor to view the IP address assigned to the ESP32-CAM.
Enter the IP address in your web browser to access the camera stream.
The model will run inference on the video feed, detecting any intrusions.
How It Works
The project uses the ESP32-CAM to capture live video, which is processed by a machine learning model trained to detect intrusions. The model uses Edge Impulse for data acquisition and training. Once deployed, the ESP32 processes the incoming video stream and identifies any intruders based on the trained model's predictions.
